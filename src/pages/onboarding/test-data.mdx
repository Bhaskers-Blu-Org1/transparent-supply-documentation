<PageDescription>

**<SolutionName />** allows authorized users to upload test data, which can then be
deleted by <SolutionName /> support upon request. The XML message test namespace
header identifies the data as test data.

</PageDescription>

## Test namespace

As opposed to **production namespace data**, **test namespace data** is not written
to the <SolutionName /> blockchain. However, test namespace data is fully available
to authorized users through all <SolutionName /> UI and API interfaces. Test namespace
data therefore enables complete testing of user scenarios and generates the same
results and user experience as production namespace data.

**Attention**: Test namespace data is not isolated from production namespace data
within the user experience context. Test namespace data can therefore reference
production namespace data, and vice versa, for testing purposes. **Your organization
must therefore adopt and communicate to users methods for identifying test data and
differentiating it from production data.**

To use a test namespace, the **IFT-Test-Namespace** header **must be** added to the
REST API request for any data uploaded to <SolutionName />. The IFT-Test-Namespace header
value will be the name of the specified test namespace. If the namespace value does
not already exist, <SolutionName /> will create it.

## How it works

The following details summarize test namespace usage:

* A test namespace can be used to delineate test data from production data.
* A test namespace does not isolate test data from production data.
* The IFT-Test-Namespace header is used to write data to a test namespace.
* Each namespace name must be unique and identify your organization, such as `<solution>.<orgId>.test1`.
* Multiple test namespaces can be created.
* Test namespaces are not supported for Fresh Insights data.
* Test namespaces and test data can be deleted by the <SolutionName /> support team, upon request.
* **You must record** and save the names of all test namespaces used in order to reference them in a delete request.
* Test namespaces can be **defined ONLY through REST API calls**. Identifying test
namespace data is not supported via UI data entries, spreadsheet uploads, or
through the product scenarios builder.

## Deleting test data

Test data (IFT-Test-Namespace header) is not written to blockchain, which enables deletion.
The data entitlement effects of deleting test data are as follows:

1. Entitlement to specific test data is removed upon deletion of the test data.
2. Entitlement to non-test data created by sharing test data persists upon deletion of the test data.

For data sharing details, refer to [Data entitlement mode](/reference/data-entitlement-mode).
