<PageDescription>

To facilitate **<SolutionName />** data uploads, you can register an **application**
as an <SolutionName /> **system user** and configure the application to submit
credentials and upload XML data (products, facilities, events, and transactions).

</PageDescription>

## GDPR notice

**Attention**: To comply with <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank">EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> data privacy requirements, you must ensure that no
personal data is uploaded to <SolutionName /> in any free-form text fields or in any comments.

## Summary

<p>
  <SolutionName /> APIs enable authenticated, authorized users, including human users, system users, and applications,
  to upload data to the network. To successfully upload asset XML, authenticated users must submit their credentials with each
  API call. Once the data is validated and accepted by <SolutionName />, the assets are available for sharing with your selected <SolutionName /> business partners.
</p>

The steps that follow illustrate the flow of creating an <SolutionName /> system ID
for an application and submitting data to <SolutionName /> through API calls:

1. To call an <SolutionName /> API, the application (system user) must have a registered
system ID. An organization administrator must create the system ID using the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'} target="_blank">
Users module</a> and manually record the generated system ID, client ID, and secret (password) for
the application. These credentials must then be stored in a form that is consumable by the
application&mdash;as a configuration file or environment variables, for example.
2. The application submits its system ID, client ID and secret in a call to the
authorization API access token endpoint. If successful, the API returns an access
token (JSON web token/JWT) to the application.
3. The application submits its received access token (JWT) in a POST call to the <SolutionName />
API Asset endpoint, to upload assets to <SolutionName />. Information
about the created asset is returned to the application.

## Authentication

<p>
  <SolutionName /> allows only authenticated users to upload data. To authenticate applications, refer to
  the <a href="../managing-users/authenticate-system-users">authenticate system users</a> documentation.
</p>

## Connector API

The <SolutionName /> <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Connector API</a>
enables authenticated users to upload data to <SolutionName />.

### User-Agent request header

When submitting requests programmatically to <SolutionName /> APIs, set the **User-Agent**
request header to a string with your organization name. Optionally, the program
name and version can be added to the string.

Example using organization name:
```
User-Agent: organizationName
```

Example using organization name, program name, and program version:
```
User-Agent: organizationName-ProgramName/1.0
```

### Post Asset XML

Call the **Assets** endpoint to submit an XML message to <SolutionName /> in the
[required format](/reference/data-types). For help generating XML messages in
the correct format, a [spreadsheet converter](/onboarding/convert-spreadsheets)
is available.

#### Swagger

The <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Connector API</a> endpoints are
provided in Swagger:

| HTTP Method| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/fs/connector/v1/assets` | Submits XML to <SolutionName /> |

For authentication, the registered user's access token [JWT](#authentication) must
be submitted in the `Authorization` header of the POST request:

| Header Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | `Bearer` + `' '` (a space character) +  [Access Token (JWT)](#authentication) |

#### Responses

One of three responses is typically returned by this endpoint:

| Response | Meaning |
| --- | ---|
| 201 | Asset Created|
| 400 | Error in XML|
| 401 | User Unauthorized |

#### Error responses

401: User Unauthorized.  A 401 response indicates a problem with the credentials
(username/password/client_id) submitted to the endpoint. Ensure that the correct
credentials for a system ID created using the <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/manageUsers'} target="_blank">Users
module</a> are submitted.

400: Bad Data.  A 400 response indicates a problem with the uploaded data. The
response includes a detailed description of the problem.

For additional information, refer to [API error messages](/reference/api-error-messages).
