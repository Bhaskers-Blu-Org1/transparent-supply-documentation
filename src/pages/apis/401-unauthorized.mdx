</PageDescription>

## Instructions to fix

If using <a href={process.env.GATSBY_UI_URL + '/ift/api/connector/swagger-ui.html'} target="_blank">Swagger</a>, ensure that you
are logged in by using the link at the top of the page (Authenticate here first).

If programmatically submitting the xml or using a 3rd party REST tool, ensure the
request header Authorization is set with a value of `Bearer <token>` in the request.
Before clicking Authenticate here first in Swagger to obtain a token, please ensure
you are in the correct environment (integration or production).
