<PageDescription>

The Connector API rejects the XML submission and returns a 400 Bad Request response.

</PageDescription>

## Instructions to fix

This is an indication that something needs to be corrected in the XML. Once corrected, the XML can
be resubmitted to Connector. The returned error message provides a description about what needs to
be corrected with the XML.

## Common issues

### Whitespace before opening XML tag

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": "The processing instruction target matching \"[xX][mM][lL]\" is not allowed."
}
```

#### Resolution

Ensure that there is no whitespace before the `<?xml>` tag.

### Data before opening XML tag

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": "Content is not allowed in prolog."
}
```

#### Resolution

Ensure that there is no data before the opening `<?xml>` tag.

### Root XML is not supported

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": "Root xml is not supported."
}
```

#### Resolution

The connector component is hardcoded to look for one of the following root XML tags and namespaces:

* Purchase Order: `order:orderMessage`
* Despatch Advice: `despatch_advice:despatchAdviceMessage`
* Receive Advice: `receiving_advice:receivingAdviceMessage`
* Master Data Item: `item_data_notification:itemDataNotificationMessage`
* Master Data Facility: `basic_party_registration:basicPartyRegistrationMessage`
* EPCIS Event: `epcis:EPCISDocument`

### Incorrectly formatted XML comments

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": "The string \"--\" is not permitted within comments."
}
```

#### Resolution

Ensure that all comments in the XML file are formatted correctly (`<!-- -->`) and do not
contain two consecutive dash characters (`--`). The following are examples of valid and invalid
XML comments:

Valid
* `<!-- Comment -->`
* `<!-- This is a well-formatted comment -->`

Invalid
* `<!-- Comment --->`
* `<!-- -- Comment -->`

### XML data missing `childEPCs`

#### API response
```json
{
  "message": "ERROR: cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'action'. One of '{childEPCs}' is expected."
}
```

#### Resolution

The `<childEPCs>` tag must be present in the XML. It does not need to contain `<epc>`
elements, but it must be present.

### XML data missing `epcList` or `quantityList`

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": ": childEPCs and childQuantityList cannot both be empty."
}
```

#### Resolution

Ensure that `epcList` or `quantityList` is present in the XML and is a correctly formed
urn.

### Invalid date

#### API response

```json
{
  "message": "ERROR:cvc-datatype-valid.1.2.1:'2006-01-10T12:00:01.000-05:00' is not a valid value for 'date'."
}
```

#### Resolution

Ensure that data in a `<date>` element only contains date information
and not time information. For example, the `orderLogisticalInformation ->
orderLogisticalDateInformation -> requestedDeliveryDateTime -> date`
field in a purchase order must be date only.

### Issue not listed
