<PageDescription>

**<SolutionName />** manages the issuance and maintenance of **access tokens**, also
known as authentication tokens, service tokens, or JSON web tokens (JWT). Each
registered user (human, system, or application) must obtain an access token in
order to use <SolutionName />.

## User types

<p>
  <SolutionName /> classifies users into two types:
</p>

1. **Human users** are authenticated via their identity service
(<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html" target="_blank">IBMid</a>)
username (email address) and password. Authenticated human users can interact
directly with the <SolutionName /> network.

2. **System users** (systems and applications) are authenticated via system ID,
client ID and secret (token). A system user ID must also be created for any
application program that calls <SolutionName /> APIs.
