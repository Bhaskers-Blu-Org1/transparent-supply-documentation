title: Whitelist custom URLs
description: IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™ whitelist custom URLs
---

<PageDescription>

Any custom UI that directly connects to <SolutionName /> **AND** uses Blockchain
Solution Manager to authenticate users must whitelist any `'returnTo'` URL that is
**NOT** the production domain name or sandbox domain name.

</PageDescription>

## Applicable cases

A custom UI uses Blockchain Solution Manager to authenticate users **ONLY** if it uses
the path &lt;*<SolutionName /> base url*&gt;/onboarding/v1/logins?returnTo=&lt;*custom UI URL*&gt;.
In this configuration, if the custom UI URL is not whitelisted, the authenticated token
will not be delivered and authentication and redirection to the custom UI URL will fail.

## Impacted environments

Both the <SolutionName /> production and sandbox environments are being restricted for improved
security.

## Required action

Open a support ticket to have your applicable custom UI URLs added to the production and sandbox
whitelists.
